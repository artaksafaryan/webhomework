 <h1 class="title">Calculator</h1>
  <p>This article is about the electronic device. For mechanical precursors to the modern calculator, see mechanical calculator.<br>
     For other uses, see Calculator (disambiguation). An electronic pocket calculator with a seven-segment liquid-crystal display<br>
    (LCD) that can perform arithmetic operationsA modern scientific calculator with a dot matrix LCD. <br>
    An electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic<br>
    to complex mathematics.
    The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s, <br>
    especially after the Intel 4004, the first microprocessor, was developed by Intel for the Japanese calculator company Busicom. <br>
    They later became used commonly within the petroleum industry (oil and gas).<br>
    Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, credit-card-sized models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers.<br>
    They became popular in the mid-1970s as the incorporation of integrated circuits reduced their size and cost. By the end of that<br>
     decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools.<br>
    Computer operating systems as far back as early Unix have included interactive calculator programs such as dc and hoc, and<br>
    calculator functions are included in almost all personal digital assistant (PDA) type devices, the exceptions being a few<br>
    dedicated address book and dictionary devices.<br>
    In addition to general purpose calculators, there are those designed for specific markets. For example, there are scientific<br>
     calculators which include trigonometric and statistical calculations. Some calculators even have the ability to do computer<br>
      algebra. Graphing calculators can be used to graph functions defined on the real line, or higher-dimensional Euclidean space.<br>
       As of 2016, basic calculators cost little, but scientific and graphing models tend to cost more.</p>
